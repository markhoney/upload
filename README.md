## Technology

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is used to provide the frontend smarts in this demo. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) has been added as a simple way to make the page look pretty, and several [Tailwind Components](https://tailwindcomponents.com/) were used to speed things up.

## Testing

Any simple Excel spreadsheet can be uploaded, but there's a test spreadsheet (called Test.xlsx) in the root of this repository.
